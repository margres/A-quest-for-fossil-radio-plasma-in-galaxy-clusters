# A quest for fossil radio plasma in galaxy clusters

In this thesis we will carry out a search for old fossil radio plasma from previous episodes ofAGN activity in the galaxy cluster MKW8 (z= 0.027). Recently, it has been realized that AGNfossil plasma might play an important role in many particle (re-)acceleration processes that takeplace in galaxy clusters. However, the scenario of galaxy clusters is complex and the diffuse radiosources present have different shapes and proprieties which are difficult to fit into a precise category.To characterize the properties of the diffuse radio emission in MKW8, we analyze 1.5 GHz VeryLarge Array (VLA) observations. We complement these data with 325 MHz Giant MetrewaveRadio Telescope (GMRT) and 150 MHz LOw Frequency ARay (LOFAR) observations. We carryspectral index and polarization studies. The diffuse radio emission shows an ultra-steep spectrum,α∼−2.40±0.17, and we set an upper limit to its degree of polarization,p= 0.8%. These results,combined with the small size of the source (about 100 kpc), the location close to the cluster center,and the filamentary structure, made us classify it as a radio phoenix.
